               Gamer's Server was born on 2 October 2017 (Monday) at 9:25 am. But before that, it was just a little
          Steam
          group called '♡BikiniBottom'. Everything starts up small right? We created this group just to show off the
          coolness of us while playing Counter Strike Global Offensive, which was the main game we used to play.
          Everyone
          had a specified character name of the cartoon 'SpongeBob Squarepants' like Patrick, Garry, Spongebob, Mr.
          Krab,
          etc. Sounds funny huh? Besides skills, good teamwork and communication are also required to help us succeed.
          So,
          rather than pressing 'k' (mic key) all day long, we found out an easier way to communicate -- Discord.
        </p>
        <p>
              Our server was created by me, the frisky admin. It was first named as 'Bikini Bottom' just like the group
          I've mentioned above. The server join link has never been changed till now because it's better to have a
          constant invitation link for a long-lasting community. In the beginning, I was just thinking about chatting
          with
          my friend with Discord, I didn't expect people would join my server. "gobroman" and "guardian toy" are the two
          earliest members who showed me huge support in the early stage of raising the server. By the way, they're now
          retired moderators.

    <div id="fortnite">

        <p>
              Not long after Fortnite had been released, we got addicted to it. We would even strike overnight just for
          one single "chicken dinner".
        </p>
        <p>
              Within a few weeks, our server had been pumped with 20+ members during the school holiday in November till
          December. Thanks to my lovingly friends. During late December in 2017, admin and his friends discussed about
          the
          changes that should be made to the server and all of them agreed to rename the server -- Gamers' Server (it
          was
          my idea). After that, I continued to create some roles with cute names and promoted some trustworthy buddies
          as
          server's moderators.

    <div id="minecraft">
      <div class="container">
        <p>
              In the mid year of 2018, playing Minecraft had become a new trend in our server. No one knows why. There
          were up to 10 daily players in our minecraft server 'gobroman.aternos.me' (created by "gobroman") back then.
          By
          the way, I was the most active player. I would wake up early in the morning and call my friend "gobroman" to
          re-open the minecraft server. I was totally addicted and mastered a lot of surviving and weapono-enchanting
          skills. Until today, Minecraft is still one of the hottest games in our server because the game deserves our
          time.

    <div id="dota">
      <div class="container">
        <p>
              In 2019, due to the crappy update of CSGO which attracted a ton of hackers, we decided to play Dota 2 and
          ended up regarding Dota 2 as our main game until today.
        </p>
        <p>
              Time flies, we have already hit 200 members on 25 May 2019. The admin team has been paying a lot of hard
          work to make this server better. We hope that you'd kindly message us to submit your suggestions and
          strengthen
          this big family together.
        </p>
        <p>
              If you finished reading all these, I appreciated you for spending valuable time on this passage. I'll
          update
          the passage again once we've reached 300 members.
